# Code Realated Features 

## Private Routes
We have implemented a private route feature in the website frontend, which ensures that only authenticated users can access certain pages. Private routes are protected by session tokens, and if a user tries to access a private route without a valid session token, they will be redirected to the login page.

## Multiple Device Login
To ensure the security of our users' accounts, we have implemented a multiple device login feature. When a user logs into their account from another device, they will be automatically logged out from their previous session. This prevents unauthorized access to a user's account and ensures that only one session is active at a time.
